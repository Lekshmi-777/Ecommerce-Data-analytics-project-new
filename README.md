📂 Project Workflow

The project follows a structured data analytics workflow:

1. Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis – Python

Python was used to inspect, clean, transform, and explore the raw retail sales dataset.

Data preparation activities:

- Inspected dataset dimensions, column names, and data types.
- Identified missing values and duplicate records.
- Removed duplicate rows.
- Removed unnecessary columns.
- Standardized text fields and categorical values.
- Converted order dates into appropriate datetime format.
- Handled missing customer information.
- Recalculated missing sales values using Quantity × Price wherever sufficient information was available.
- Exported the cleaned dataset for further analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

- Analyzed sales distribution across regions.
- Examined product-wise revenue contributions.
- Evaluated monthly sales performance.
- Explored category-level sales distribution.
- Created visualizations to identify trends and patterns.

2. SQL Analysis – MySQL

The cleaned dataset was imported into MySQL under the database:

"Retail_Sales_Analysis"

A table named "Sales_Data" was created to store the retail transaction records.

SQL was used to answer business-related questions through aggregation, filtering, sorting, subqueries, and window functions.

Business Queries Performed:

No.| Business Question| SQL Concepts Used
1| What is the total sales revenue by region?| GROUP BY, SUM, ORDER BY
2| Which are the top 5 products by revenue?| GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT
3| What is the monthly sales trend?| DATE_FORMAT, SUM, GROUP BY
4| Which regions generate more than ₹5 lakh in sales?| GROUP BY, HAVING
5| What is the cumulative monthly sales performance?| SUM() OVER(), Window Functions
6| What is the average order value by region?| AVG(), ROUND(), GROUP BY
7| Which product generates the highest sales in each region?| RANK(), PARTITION BY
8| What is the month-over-month sales growth?| LAG(), Window Functions

3. Interactive Dashboard Development – Power BI

An interactive Retail Sales Analysis Dashboard was developed in Power BI to present the key findings in a visually accessible format.

The dashboard includes the following components:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Total Sales
- Total Orders
- Average Order Value
- Total Products
- Total Regions

Dashboard Visualizations
[01-11-2026 19:24] Untamed: Visualization| Business Purpose
Monthly Sales Trend| Understand monthly revenue fluctuations
Sales by Region| Compare regional sales performance
Sales by Category| Identify category-wise revenue contribution
Top 5 Products by Sales| Identify leading revenue-generating products
Quarterly Sales Performance| Compare performance across quarters
Top Region| Highlight the highest-performing region
Top Product| Highlight the highest-revenue product
Top Month| Identify the month with the highest sales

Interactive Filters / Slicers

- Date Range
- Category
- Product
- Region

These filters allow users to explore sales performance across different time periods, products, categories, and geographical regions.

📊 Key Business Insights

Based on the current Power BI dashboard:

1. Regional Sales Performance

- South is the highest-performing region, contributing approximately 1.29M in sales.
- East follows with approximately 1.10M.
- North contributes approximately 0.62M.
- West contributes approximately 0.30M.

Business Recommendation: Investigate the factors contributing to strong performance in South and East and explore opportunities to improve sales in lower-performing regions.

2. Product Performance

- Laptop is the highest revenue-generating product, contributing approximately 1.22M.
- Monitor, Headphones, and Tablet follow.
- Phone contributes comparatively lower revenue among the top five products.

Business Recommendation: Monitor inventory availability and regional demand for high-performing products. Evaluate product margins before making inventory expansion decisions.

3. Category-Wise Sales

- Electronics contributes approximately 1.4M.
- Unknown Category contributes approximately 1.3M.
- Accessories contributes approximately 1.1M.

Business Recommendation: Investigate unclassified product records to improve category-level reporting accuracy and ensure reliable business decisions.

4. Monthly and Quarterly Performance

- February is identified as the top month in the displayed dashboard.
- Q1 and Q4 show stronger sales performance compared with Q2 and Q3.

Business Recommendation: Investigate seasonal demand patterns, promotional activities, and product availability to understand variations in sales performance.

5. Data Quality Observations

The analysis identified missing and incomplete information in fields such as:

- Order Date
- Product
- Category
- Region
- Quantity
- Price
- Sales

Business Recommendation: Establish consistent data-validation practices and improve source-data completeness to increase the reliability of business reporting.

Note: Dashboard figures are rounded displayed values. They should be reconciled against the final cleaned dataset before being treated as audited business results.
